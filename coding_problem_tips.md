## Tips to Follow

- Avoid using the submit button and look up the code before submit so you don't have to make changes again and again. Make a revisit all the lines and make changes once. 
- Once the submit button is clicked it is the final submit not checking again
- On LeetCode or other website check for the good problems and solve them not just always go for the easy ones.
- Do problems on own and dedicate time on good problems not just waste time
- Have a consistency in solving the problems and don't give up.
- Start with easy and move up to the tough ones.
- Also migrate to the different topics of programming just slow and easy.
- work on topics you are not good at don't left them.
- Filter out the problems and solve them
- Step out of the comfort zone and explore the new area of the problems that makes you uncomfortable.
- Make progress don't get stuck.
- Read the solution it helps some time and resubmit.
- Make a goal for a day.
- Revisit the code and see if you can make the code more better and optimize it or make a new function and use it.
- Allocate a certain amount of time to complete the problem if not able to solve check the solution don't waste a lot of time like hours and hours on single problem.
- start ->easy->medium->hard, middle ground is good.
- Start with easy data structure and then code them.
- Don't give up take atleast 30 mins to solve the problem.
- Try to understand the thought process of solving the problem even by looking at the solution.
- Simulate the real world as problem is done on the interview and best is done on  paper.
- Make a log of mistakes and work on that and check the solution based on that.
- First brute force and then optimize the solution.

- Code review tips - keep the amount of code small,  leave the comment in the code it should be clear
- Algo to work on -  DFS, BFS, Matching Brackets problem, Hash table, Memoization, Caching technique, Manipulate multiple pointers, understanding the sorting algo (run time of algo), Recursion, Construct a custom data structure, Binary Search  
- Language needed -  Objective C, Python, JavaScript, be good in multiple language as it opens more opportunity.
